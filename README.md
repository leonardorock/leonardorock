### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer with 8+ years of experience primarily focused on Apple platforms such as iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS. Over the years, I have developed a deep understanding of Apple's ecosystem and have honed my skills in developing high-quality, intuitive applications for these platforms.

I have had the privilege of working with some amazing companies such as IBM, Santander, Natura, and PicPay in the past. Currently, I am working as a senior consultant at Thoughtworks where I have the opportunity to work with talented individuals on some exciting projects.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small mobile applications to large-scale enterprise applications. I am passionate about developing clean, efficient code and utilizing the latest technologies and best practices to create exceptional user experiences.

My expertise lies in Swift and Objective-C programming languages, and I am experienced in creating applications with complex user interfaces and integrating with APIs and third-party libraries. I have worked on various areas of app development including keyboard extensions, widget kit, and dependency management with CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager.
